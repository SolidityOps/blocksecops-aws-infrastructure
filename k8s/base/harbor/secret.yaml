# DEPRECATED: Hardcoded secrets are no longer used
#
# All secrets are now managed via Vault and ExternalSecrets
# For Harbor credentials, use ExternalSecret resources that pull from:
#
# Harbor Database Secret:
# - Vault path: secret/data/harbor/database
# - Keys: POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB
#
# Harbor Core Secret:
# - Vault path: secret/data/harbor/core
# - Keys: HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD, secretKey
#
# Harbor Redis Integration:
# - Vault path: secret/data/redis
# - Key: password
#
# Example ExternalSecret configuration is in overlays/<environment>/harbor/externalsecret.yaml
