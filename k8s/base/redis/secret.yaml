# DEPRECATED: Hardcoded secrets are no longer used
#
# All secrets are now managed via Vault and ExternalSecrets
# For Redis credentials, use ExternalSecret resources that pull from:
# - Vault path: secret/data/redis
# - Key: password
#
# Example ExternalSecret configuration is in overlays/<environment>/redis/externalsecret.yaml
