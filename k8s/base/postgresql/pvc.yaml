# Note: PVC is defined as volumeClaimTemplates in the StatefulSet
# This file serves as documentation for the PVC configuration

# The actual PVC is created automatically by the StatefulSet with these specifications:
# - name: postgresql-data
# - accessModes: ReadWriteOnce
# - storage: 10Gi (base configuration)
# - storageClassName: gp3

# For reference, this would be the standalone PVC if not using StatefulSet:
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
# metadata:
#   name: postgresql-data
# spec:
#   accessModes:
#   - ReadWriteOnce
#   resources:
#     requests:
#       storage: 10Gi
#   storageClassName: gp3
