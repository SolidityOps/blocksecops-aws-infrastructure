# DEPRECATED: Hardcoded secrets are no longer used
#
# All secrets are now managed via Vault and ExternalSecrets
# For PostgreSQL credentials, use ExternalSecret resources that pull from:
# - Vault path: secret/data/postgresql
# - Keys: POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_REPLICATION_USER, POSTGRES_REPLICATION_PASSWORD
#
# Example ExternalSecret configuration is in overlays/<environment>/postgresql/externalsecret.yaml
